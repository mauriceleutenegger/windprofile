To generate the fits file for windtabs, you need to build and install windabsorption:

./setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/python/libs/
or
./setup.py install --home=~
(will install in ~/lib/python/)
This will compile and install the module. The purpose of the module is to calculate 
the transmission of the wind as a function of tau_*. It can also take other parameters
than the defaults. 

The script generate_windtabs.py will call windabsorption to
output a FITS file for use in the XSPEC local model windtabs. You can then 
copy this file into the dat/ directory on the local model root tree.

The script porous_windtabs.py is another example, finding T(tau) for
a variety of porosity lengths, and also generating FITS output files.

Finally plot_windtabs.py will take the output of the previous two scripts and
plot them for comparison.

Requirements:
python3.X
numpy
pyfits (now astropy.io.fits)
